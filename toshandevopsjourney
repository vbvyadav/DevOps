Certainly! Here's a sample Docker Compose YAML file that demonstrates a basic setup with two services:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./web-content:/usr/share/nginx/html

  db:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=myapp
      - MYSQL_USER=myuser
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=mypassword
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db-data:
```

Let's go through the file:

- The `version` specifies the version of Docker Compose file syntax being used. In this case, it's version 3.9.

- Under `services`, we define two services: `web` and `db`.

  - The `web` service uses the `nginx:latest` image and maps port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container. It also mounts the `./web-content` directory from the host to the `/usr/share/nginx/html` directory in the container.

  - The `db` service uses the `mysql:latest` image and sets up environment variables for configuring the MySQL database. It also mounts a volume named `db-data` to persist the database data in the container.

- Finally, the `volumes` section defines a named volume called `db-data`. This volume is used by the `db` service to store its data.

To use this Docker Compose file, save it as `docker-compose.yml` and run the `docker-compose up` command in the same directory. It will start the two services defined in the file, pulling the necessary images if they are not already present on your system.

Feel free to modify this file according to your specific requirements.
